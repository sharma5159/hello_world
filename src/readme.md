JAVA
IDE :integrated development environment - where we can type the sourcecode , compile and run the sourcecode 
All these happens in one software , so we use IDE

When there is a sourcecode , it gets converted into the bytecode using a compiler and run those bytecode into a machine called JVM or macOS and objects gets created and run your code
